    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use and love <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword">1Password</a> on my Mac every day – it has become one of those things I can’t live without, and is easily worth the $40 price.</p>

<p>Yesterday they announced their very generous ThanksGiving offer: <a href="http://agile.ws/ThankYou">Free 1-for-1 license</a>. So I can give away a Free 1Password for Mac license – and since no one else in my family has started using a Mac full-time yet, I will give it away to you!</p>

<p>Just add a comment here – saying why I should give it away to you and wait for a few hours. I will pick one person here and send them the license. Make sure you leave some contact so I can get back to you. How will I pick? The most entertaining comment of course. But yeah – don’t hold me to it, I might just randomly pick someone.</p>

<p>Thank you for playing!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On a photo uploading spree today.</p>

<p>The first album consists photos from Hamilton Park and Alki Beach, a beautiful area in West Seattle. Because of it’s location, you get great views of Seattle and the Harbor from here, specially great in the evening.</p>

    <updated>2009-02-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://arnab.github.com/posts/2009/02/i-didnt-tip-the-cab-today</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got back from Las Vegas. The trip was good (details and pics coming soon) – but I did not tip the cab on my way back from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle-Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea-Tac</a> Airport to my place today.</p>

<p>I usually do. And a lot. In fact my friends say that I tip too much – whether in restaurants, in saloons or in cabs. Today was different – and I honestly did not think that the driver deserved even a cent. Moreover, I actually wrote down a big “$ 0.00″ in the tip section of the receipt. Here’s what happened, from scratch.</p>

<p>Got down at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle-Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea-Tac</a> around 9:35 PST. The Seattle Metro bus 194 had just left and the next one was a 30 minute wait. BTW, the Metro 194 route is a real nice transport to/from the airport if you are in downtown Seattle. The route is via I-5 and it takes about 30 min to get there – hassle free. And after you read what I am about to write, I hope you will also rate the Metro 194 as a good service – at least better than some cabs.</p>

<p>So we decided to get a cab home – and got into one. I have taken cabs from SeaTac to my house 7 times in the last 1.5 years. And I am positive that it was always around $34-$36 – and I would mark it up to $40 and a nice “thank you”. Today it ran up to $41.</p>

<p>Anyway that’s not the problem – I wanted to know if the fare had increased (I remember that there is a flat rate of around $33 to/from SeaTac and downtown). So I asked the driver if there was a flat rate from SeaTac. He said that it’s $35 flat from downtown to SeaTac but not while returning. And I thought they have a card in every cab that states the flat rates – so I asked for it. The guy was pissed off. I don’t know what crime I committed (as far as I know, I asked him in the most polite way possible – I didn’t want to come off as a cheapo).</p>

<p>He got agitated and said that there’s no such card, the fares increased in October and I can pay him $41 now. So I asked him if he can swipe my card (I was carrying $40 cash – as my previous experience had thought me to to). He took the card, swiped it and asked me to sign my receipt.</p>

<p>It was all okay till this part – here’s when the fun started. I was giving him my autograph when he started off in Hindi – “Tum saale Desi logon ka yahii problem hai”. (for my non-hindi-speaking friends, that means something like “This is the problem with you Desi (Indian) people”) hmmm… I was not gonna take that sitting back – and I thought it was a racial slur. As far as I am concerned, the situation or my behavior did not warrant a racial slur (really, nothing does. Or should). I had never heard (or maybe I never recognized it) racial abuse so far – and that too from another Indian/Pakistani? <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> . So I told him, in English, as I didn’t want to go down this path – that, this was uncalled-for and was really bad.</p>

<p>By now he was out of control – shouting and enraged (and I swear I did not call him any names at all). So I said, I am not going to sign the receipt if this goes on. I asked him to shake hands, take the receipt and go home (Ok, even I was not the most polite person by now, but I was not bad-mouthing). His reply was – “Pay and get out of my cab.” He tried to threaten me by picking up the phone and starting to dial someone. I thought it was the police – and that they would be fair mediators <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> So I said, “Who are you calling, the Police? Ok – let’s wait for them – I am not signing the receipt till then.” And then he gave in, again shouted me to get out of his car.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got his badge number and details – and he asked me if I was going to file a complaint. On hearing “yes, obviously” he shrugged and muttered something.</p>

<p>So – I just left all the details of the complaint on the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/consumeraffairs/fsw&amp;m.htm">Seattle TaxiCab complaint hotline</a> (BTW – a nice IVR system. I initially expected them to call me back during “working hours” – the number’s 206-296-TAXI). Also left a voice mail with STITA cabs complaint line.</p>

<p>Maybe the fare has risen and is now more than $40. Maybe the sites that Google turns up are still not updated with the latest fares (they still say the fare should be around $35) -
<a href="http://www.engr.washington.edu/epp/icders/transp.html">http://www.engr.washington.edu/epp/icders/transp.html</a>
<a href="http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/ground/groundrates.shtml#d">http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/ground/groundrates.shtml#d</a></p>

<p>Or maybe the meter was rigged? Maybe STITA cabs really deserve the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/stita-taxi-seattle">bad bad reviews they have on yelp</a> (oh and they are going to get another one in a few minutes).</p>

<p>But what I am sure of is that it did not deserve all the rude behavior, racial slurs I got from the driver.</p>

<p>Let’s see what turns up – both complaint lines acknowledged the entry and said that they will get back (in fact I have heard good things about Seattle Cab complaints) within a few days. Will update the blog when I hear from them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Jan 7th, 2009 I completed a year at Amazon and Seattle!</p>

<p>What a year it has been! At first I had some doubts about leaving all the people I know (at NYC) and coming over to a new far away place and to a radically different organization. But, now that I look back on it, and I hope I am not speaking too soon, it looks like it was one of the best decisions in my life!</p>

<p>Thanks to Amazon and my colleagues (special thanks goes to <a href="http://saaridev.wordpress.com">Ali Rizvi</a>) and the awesome community of brilliant engineers at Amazon I have gained a totally new view of technology in the large, programming to be concise.</p>

<p>It’s a world I am loving and living every moment. And the Stocks that you get after a year helps too <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>And I met <a href="http://twitter.com/ujwala">Ujwala</a> here! Bet you’ll be hearing a lot about that!</p>

<p>So what do you think? Hasn’t it been an awesome year?</p>
