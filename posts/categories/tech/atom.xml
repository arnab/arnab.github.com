    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some work I did recently, I had to produce a visual diff of text.
A visual diff makes it easy for the user to understand what exactly
changed with a quick scan.</p>

<p>There's an excellent library from Google, called
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/">diff_match_patch</a>
that does a really good job of analyzing the text and producing the
diffs in a programatic manner. However, it lacks the sauce to visually
present it to the user.</p>

<p>So I wrote a jQuery library which is a wrapper around Google's library
and makes it trivial to wow your users.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First, a demo (the fiddle can be found
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/arnab/YwSVY/">here</a>):</p>

<iframe
        style="width: 60%; height: 430px"
        src="http://jsfiddle.net/arnab/YwSVY/embedded/result,html,js,resources,css/"
        allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"
        frameborder="0">
</iframe>


<p>While Google's library is excellent from a NLP-perspective, it does
not provide a way to show the diff in a beautiful manner. They have a
reference implementation to produce the diff in HTML, but recommend
you write your own (also this implmentation is inflexible in terms of
changing style/elements etc.).</p>

<p>Also, this library is produced in 7 different languages - so the code
that uses this is not particularly pleasing to look at.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the code you would have to write to produce a
good looking diff:
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4700669.js?file=pretty-diff.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>diff_match_patch.prototype.diff_prettyHtml = function(diffs) {
    var html = [];
    var pattern_amp = /&amp;/g;
    var pattern_lt = /&lt;/g;
    var pattern_gt = /&gt;/g;
    var pattern_para = /\n/g;
    for (var x = 0; x &lt; diffs.length; x++) {
      var op = diffs[x][0];    // Operation (insert, delete, equal)
      var data = diffs[x][1];  // Text of change.
      //var text = data.replace(pattern_amp, '&amp;amp;').replace(pattern_lt, '&amp;lt;')
      //    .replace(pattern_gt, '&amp;gt;').replace(pattern_para, '&amp;para;&lt;br&gt;');
      var text = data.replace(pattern_amp, '&amp;amp;').replace(pattern_lt, '&amp;lt;')
          .replace(pattern_gt, '&amp;gt;').replace(pattern_para, '&lt;br&gt;');
      switch (op) {
        case DIFF_INSERT:
          html[x] = '&lt;ins style=&quot;background:#e6ffe6;&quot;&gt;' + text + '&lt;/ins&gt;';
          break;
        case DIFF_DELETE:
          html[x] = '&lt;del style=&quot;background:#ffe6e6;&quot;&gt;' + text + '&lt;/del&gt;';
          break;
        case DIFF_EQUAL:
          html[x] = '&lt;span&gt;' + text + '&lt;/span&gt;';
          break;
      }
    }
    return html.join('');
  };
  </code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>So I wrote a library to wrap around it - so the client doesn't have to
repeat this wherever they need to use it. You can find more on
<a href="https://github.com/arnab/jQuery.PrettyTextDiff/">github</a> and it can
be downloaded from the
<a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/pretty-text-diff/">jQuery plugins site</a>.</p>

<p>Now, with this library you'd have to write just a couple of lines to
produce a beautiful looking diff, like this:
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4700669.js?file=pretty-diff-with-textdiff-plugin.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>$(selector).prettyTextDiff({
  // options
});
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Peek inside the fiddle demo to see more. You can also customize many
of the options - check out the documentation in the github repo.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p>PS: Some of the motivation was also to flex my muscles with
CofeeScript (haven't had a chance to use it for the last 2-3 months)
and setting up compile and uglifying/compressing  of the Javascript
with <code>cake</code>. Check out the simple
<a href="https://github.com/arnab/jQuery.PrettyTextDiff/blob/master/jquery.pretty-text-diff.coffee">coffeescript code</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/arnab/jQuery.PrettyTextDiff/blob/master/Cakefile">Cakefile</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-23T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://arnab-deka.com/posts/2012/09/state-of-e-commerce-in-india</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, since moving back to India 4 months ago, we’ve trying to buy stuff
off the internet, like we did back in Seattle (oh Amazon), from
diapers to audio CDs (whaaaat? I know). While the world is much much
better compared to 2006, there are still some Idiocracies in the UX
and process. There are the big players (<a href="http://www.flipkart.com/">FlipKart</a>, <a href="http://www.infibeam.com/">infibeam</a>
and the like) where (from the 4 months experience) you’d find what you
are looking almost 6-7 times out of 10. The long-tail of e-commerce in
India is the real deal though – the tail is really really long. I use
<a href="http://www.junglee.com/">Junglee.com</a> to find the long time and almost always (9+ out of
10) the things I am looking for are found somewhere. Funny thing is
that you’ll never find two things you need in one site. Over these 4
months, I don’t think any of these sites have come up more than once
in my search.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To highlight some of the other differences:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>No guest checkout</strong>: Almost nobody has guest checkout. Everybody
  requires you to register and require your email and phone. Most
  the package tracking is done thru SMS so that’s ok, but I’ve had
  some spam (email and SMS) originating from here as well. But for
  the most part, they are well behaved (I don't know why they need
  my birthday or gender to ship stuff me though– anyway they get
  wrong info for such questions ;))</li>
<li><strong>Weak integration with backend</strong>: More than once I have placed
  orders (after signing up etc.) only to be informed later that
  the item is not in stock. The websites are more like marketing
  websites with a cart/checkout process and it looks like the
  orders are processed completely separately.</li>
<li><strong>Cash-On-Delivery</strong>: Almost everyone takes COD orders. I know
  some people don’t like the idea, but for Indian e-commerce it’s
  a must. Mostly because if you pay when you order on the site and
  then you don’t get the thing or get something else, there’s
  pretty much nothing you can do. Most sites will process a refund
  but you have to call them a few times to get that done. And some
  sites only give you a coupon that you can use in their site. So
  COD is heaven-sent and must-needed for such small sites.
  <a href="http://www.flipkart.com/s/help/payments">FlipKart has started doing Card-On-Delivery</a>, which is even better!</li>
<li><strong>Faaaaaast and FREE shipping</strong>: Almost every order I have made
  has been delivered within a few days. In one-third of the cases it’s
  within 2 days. And it’s 99% of the time free shipping.</li>
</ul>


<p>To summarize, for the most part, it’s all good. You can find 9/10
things online and of that you can get 9/10 items delivered at your
doorstep within a reasonable amount of time and pay after you
get/inspect it. But that’s not why I started writing this piece today…</p>

<h2>A uniquely horrible experience at ezmaal.com</h2>

<p>What I wanted to do today was share a very bad experience on one of
these small player’s sites today. Remember the band called
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Route-Indian-Music-Hindi-Modern/dp/B0013LKL36/">Silk Route</a>? Heard them on radio and remembered how awesome their
music was. Unfortunately the album’s not on spotify or in Amazon/MP3.
So I looked up FlipKart (out of stock) and Junglee. That’s where I
found <a href="http://www.ezmaal.com/">ezmaal.com</a> – and they had it in stock! So I went through
the registration process and signed up for an account.</p>

<p>Now, I use the <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">most excellent 1Password</a> for creating random
passwords for every site and to manage signing-in/out. Did the same on
ezmaal too – and it was all fine and dandy and got an account created.
Now, just before checking out I wanted to see if the login/logout was
working (you never know with small sites). So I opened up the site in
an <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=95464">incognito window</a> and tried loggin in. Here’s the screenshot of
what I got back: [![ezmaal login failure][11]][11]
click to see larger image</p>

<ol>
<li>They throw a really garbage un-customized ASP.net error in the
customer’s face. It means nothing to me!</li>
<li>They are trying to validate my password for script-injection. I
don’t think they are actively doing this, but it’s probably part of
ASP.net and they have not tested and not coded to handle login
failures. Really really bad if the login on your site throws up gibberish.</li>
<li><strong>Password displayed on screen</strong>: The worst part is that they
print my password three times on the screen, verbatim. Thank God I use
1Password and have a random (and more importantly, different) password
on every site. But like most customer’s if I had a
one-password-for-all and used that in here, it’s as good as being
leaked. If nowhere else, this will be on their server-logs. An
employee only need to grep for <code>Password\=</code> in the logs. On top of
this, with this kind of an experience, I have no faith that they
salt/hash the passwords. I am more willing to believe that they keep
it all in cleartext in a SQLServer database.</li>
</ol>


<p>I have seen bad e-commerce sites before, but will I shop at a place
which does not care about my online security? No way in hell (yeah, I
did not complete that order)!</p>

    <id>http://arnab-deka.com/posts/2009/09/interesting-job-advertisement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A recent job opening advert (from <a href="http://vark.com/jobs#feeng">Aardvark, for a Front-End Web Developers</a>) goes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Required Skills:
* Fluency in HTML and CSS
* Experience taking mockups and turning them into standards-compliant HTML/CSS
* Expertise in achieving cross-browser compatibility in IE, Firefox, and Safari
* Experience in implementing grid-based layouts in HTML/CSS
* Experience in an agile development environment</p>

<p>Pluses:
* Interest in user experience design and graphic design
* Experience in Javascript and Ruby on Rails
* History of side projects and interest in social media, browsers, and mobile web
* Obsession with new technologies and open source tools
* Experimental, user focused, and iterative
* Previous startup experience</p></blockquote>

<p>I felt the Pluses section was very interesting, specially (you kinda see the others on Rails related job boards anyway):
* History of side projects and interest in social media, browsers, and mobile web
* Obsession with new technologies and open source tools</p>

<p>Shows how today’s start-ups value people who are really interested in what they do (and not just in for the money). An encouraging view of the world indeed – now I just have to get on it and get those much needed Plusses into my skills bag <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>Note to my employers, friends, well wishers and anyone else interested: This does not mean I am looking for a job! I love the job I have right now and am just happy to see the importance of “passion” in the world’s view of an ideal employee increasing!</p>

    <link href="http://arnab-deka.com/posts/2009/09/rails-guides-on-my-kindle-dx-or-any-webpage-for-that-matter/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://arnab-deka.com/posts/2009/09/rails-guides-on-my-kindle-dx-or-any-webpage-for-that-matter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015TCML0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=arnsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0015TCML0">Amazon Kindle DX</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=arnsblo-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0015TCML0" alt="" /> for a birthday gift! Thanks Ujwala!</p>

<p>And so far I am loving it. It’s better to read on compared to Kindle 1 (which, BTW, Ujwala had gifted to me last year) – and the native PDF support (and the search-anywhere) is awesome! The experimental browser that comes with the DX is much much improved compared to Kindle 1st Gen.</p>

<p>So I was reading more about <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html">Rails Routing in the rails-guides</a>. And while I was in the bus today morning I wanted to read that on the Kindle (coz it is a pleasure to read on it). So I fired up the guides page on the experimental browser – it works, but reading a PDF or a Kindle-formatted book is so much better.</p>

<p>So I got this simple idea. Print the web page as a PDF and e-mail it to your Kindle. Here’s what I did:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the site</li>
<li>Print – (PDF format “saved to file” instead of sending it to a printer). I was on Linux – Mac also has the “Print to PDF/PS support by default, for Windows you’ll need to get <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/">CutePDF</a> installed)</li>
<li>e-mail it to your Kindle address (I also uploaded it to my dropbox – so I can get it later on) and you are done!</li>
</ol>


<p>(BTW, dropbox is an amazing thing – if you use multiple computers/OS, you have to try this thing. If you are going to try it out (for free), help me out – <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTEzMDYwMzk">use my Dropbox referral link</a>)</p>

<p>So there you go – another easy way to get web-content for free on your Kindle. Go on enjoy the book now.</p>
