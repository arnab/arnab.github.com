    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know I play cricket in the summer regularly? Yeah – we all play in the Eagles Team.</p>

<p>We did well in the 2008 Summer season. We won 6 out of 9 league matches (and the first was a very thrilling tie). In the last league match we even <a href="http://arcl.org/Pages/UI/Matchscorecard.aspx?match_id=2974&amp;league_id=8&amp;season_id=13">scored 102 for 1 wicket</a> (the highest and only 100+ opening partnership) – and I scored 47 there. So we came out 3rd in the league and got promoted to the next level for 2009.</p>

<p>See my <a href="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/2008/08/some-pics-of-my-cricket-team-eagles">earlier post regarding this</a>.</p>

<p>So last Saturday, Jan 24th, we had the ARCL prize distribution ceremony (at Microsoft Cafe #43)</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=3050+152nd+Ave+NE+Redmond,+WA+98052&amp;sll=47.64083,-122.135246&amp;sspn=0.008501,0.023775&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=47.645152,-122.131834&amp;spn=0.020239,0.036478&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr">View Larger Map</a></p>

<p>It was good. But
1) we reached late – so didn’t get food <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" />
2) we came third – and got a nice team trophy. But the 1st and the 2nd spots get personal trophies with names engraved! Well next year!Here’s the link to the <a href="http://arcl.org/Pages/UI/DivHome.aspx?league_id=8&amp;season_id=13">ARCL site 2008 Summer league</a> – it’s one of those sites that work well only on IE (or IE tab, for hardcore FFox-ers).</p>

<p>BTW, is the site screaming for a scrapping-goodness?</p>

<p><strong>Update on 02-Feb-2009</strong> – <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Bharath-Mukkati/32819317">Bharat </a> took an iPhone pic of the trophy – it looks damn good!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=safeco+field&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=0,0,1076296656903599956&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A"><img src="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=safeco+field&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=0,0,1076296656903599956&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A" alt="" /></a>
Went to the Mariners game vs the Yankees last night. Was at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=safeco+field&amp;fb=1&amp;cid=0,0,1076296656903599956&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Safeco Field</a>, right next to my office.</p>

<p>It was a win-win for me any way, cause I love the Yankees and cause of the NY connection; and of course Mariners are from Seattle! Mariners don’t win often (and this season had not won any yet) – however they command a lot of local support.</p>

<p>Matter of fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez">A-Rod</a> was getting booed big time (A-Rod used to play at the start of his career with the Mariners). I was on the handful side of the Yankees supporters, with a Yanks t-shirt and all…</p>

<p>And guess what – Mariners won 3-1… Their yound pitcher Morrow was awesome… read more <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/sports/baseball/06yankees.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>On the whole – loved it. The atmosphere was awesome… and so was the view of Seattle as a backdrop against the ballpark – with the sunset and everything.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of pics, one before sunset and one at night…</p>
