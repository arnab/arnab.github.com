  <div class="entry-content"><p>People have always been telling me to get move away from blogger. In late 2008, I read a few really good articles on why – and I was convinced. Sorry – but it seems I did not bookmark(<a href="http://delicious.com/arnab.deka/">delicious</a> them). Tried to look for them now, but I get a few business oriented results only.</p>

<p>Anyway, I always wanted to get my own domain. And play around with Rails, Capistrano etc. to launch it. So here it is. I did spend a lot of time creating it. But finally, I think I am going the low-hanging-fruit (agile?) way – so right now it’s the simple, easy and open source <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> running on my host.</p>

<p>I am planning to add some dynamic mashup content (like my activity list from all the services I use, and some news that I feed in all mashed up). Let’s see where it goes.</p>

<p>A few of my early 2009 goals were to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>, master vim and Rails and then use all that to prototype my site. Status</p>

<ul>
<li>Dvorak – home row + 4 top row keys done – progress is slow – but it’s good</li>
<li>vim – well I have been using it for a couple of years now. But now I am really learning it. I really like Swaroop C H’s <a href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Vim">A Byte of Vim</a>. And with some snazzy plugins (rails.vim, project.vim, surround.vim and fuzzyfind.vim it is really becoming the best editor ever)</li>
<li>Rails – I have been using it for a year now. And I can do the “good stuff” – but now I am learning in-depth. Feels great to learn the details of the various components</li>
</ul>


<p>Along the way, git came. And I got hooked to that too. But anyway, things <strong>are</strong> moving along and I am happy about that.</p>

<p>So one of my goals (getting my site working) is done. Here it is – <a href="http://www.arnab-deka.com"><strong>www.arnab-deka.com</strong></a> (bye bye blogger – will miss you)</p>

<p>Now it’s up to improving it. Will keep you updated!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Jan 7th, 2009 I completed a year at Amazon and Seattle!</p>

<p>What a year it has been! At first I had some doubts about leaving all the people I know (at NYC) and coming over to a new far away place and to a radically different organization. But, now that I look back on it, and I hope I am not speaking too soon, it looks like it was one of the best decisions in my life!</p>

<p>Thanks to Amazon and my colleagues (special thanks goes to <a href="http://saaridev.wordpress.com">Ali Rizvi</a>) and the awesome community of brilliant engineers at Amazon I have gained a totally new view of technology in the large, programming to be concise.</p>

<p>It’s a world I am loving and living every moment. And the Stocks that you get after a year helps too <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>And I met <a href="http://twitter.com/ujwala">Ujwala</a> here! Bet you’ll be hearing a lot about that!</p>

<p>So what do you think? Hasn’t it been an awesome year?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know I play cricket in the summer regularly? Yeah – we all play in the Eagles Team.</p>

<p>We did well in the 2008 Summer season. We won 6 out of 9 league matches (and the first was a very thrilling tie). In the last league match we even <a href="http://arcl.org/Pages/UI/Matchscorecard.aspx?match_id=2974&amp;league_id=8&amp;season_id=13">scored 102 for 1 wicket</a> (the highest and only 100+ opening partnership) – and I scored 47 there. So we came out 3rd in the league and got promoted to the next level for 2009.</p>

<p>See my <a href="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/2008/08/some-pics-of-my-cricket-team-eagles">earlier post regarding this</a>.</p>

<p>So last Saturday, Jan 24th, we had the ARCL prize distribution ceremony (at Microsoft Cafe #43)</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=3050+152nd+Ave+NE+Redmond,+WA+98052&amp;sll=47.64083,-122.135246&amp;sspn=0.008501,0.023775&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=47.645152,-122.131834&amp;spn=0.020239,0.036478&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr">View Larger Map</a></p>

<p>It was good. But
1) we reached late – so didn’t get food <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" />
2) we came third – and got a nice team trophy. But the 1st and the 2nd spots get personal trophies with names engraved! Well next year!Here’s the link to the <a href="http://arcl.org/Pages/UI/DivHome.aspx?league_id=8&amp;season_id=13">ARCL site 2008 Summer league</a> – it’s one of those sites that work well only on IE (or IE tab, for hardcore FFox-ers).</p>

<p>BTW, is the site screaming for a scrapping-goodness?</p>

<p><strong>Update on 02-Feb-2009</strong> – <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Bharath-Mukkati/32819317">Bharat </a> took an iPhone pic of the trophy – it looks damn good!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love feeding on bits of information. The world is full of interesting things and the Internet has a thousand ways of feeding you all that.</p>

<p>If you are not this type of a person – and like to live in your own shell (nothing bad with that) – you can stop reading now – and use your time well doing something else. Like living in your own shell.</p>

<p>Back to the topic – I do skim most of the info dished out at me. Some I keep in my “hmmm” folder of my brain (you guessed it – doesn’t stick long), some I delicious-mark. The rest are the really interesting ones – I find it hard to not share with people I know.</p>

<p>Like this –  <a href="http://bit.ly/17q25">http://bit.ly/17q25</a> written by @<a href="http://twitter.com/zen_habits">zen_habits</a>
(this article is on how to use twitter well – I have a truckload, or maybe a trainload of people I know, who tell me – “What is twitter anyway? Just another Social Media Platform? Why would I want to go to yet another site? Is Facebook/Orkut/MySpace/insert-your-fav-social-media-network<insert-your-fav-social-nw> not enough already?” This is an</insert-your-fav-social-nw> excellent article on why and how twitter.)</p>

<p>How can I not make my friends read this? <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> </p>
Now if it was 3 months ago, I would have snapped the link up in an e-mail and sent it to all of you, hoping that you’ll also read it and like it and apply it. This group of people would include at least all interesting folks I know in India, NY and Seattle – that’s a lot of people right? And most probably won’t even read it (yeah I know – it’s ok)</p>

<p>No more – I just twit it now – with the knowledge that whoever wants to eat info-blurbs like I do will follow me and read it.</p>

<p>That’s why I urge you my friends/social-beings/netizens, give the article above a read – here it is again for effect – </span><a href="http://bit.ly/17q25">http://bit.ly/17q25</a></p>
If you do get convinced that twitter is a big idea, can be useful to you and actually help in reducing spam, get an account fast.</p>

<p>You can follow me if you like – </span><a href="http://twitter.com/arnab_deka">http://twitter.com/arnab_deka</a>
Or check out the people I follow – there are some interesting folks – and follow them instead.</p>
And finally, here are some interesting/info on why/how etc. of twitter: <a href="http://delicious.com/arnab.deka/twitter">http://delicious.com/arnab.deka/twitter</a></p>

<p></span>If you are still not convinced and take nothing else from this blog, take this back – you can rest assured that you’ll get spam from one less person now on.</p>

<time datetime="2008-12-24T00:00:00+05:30" pubdate data-updated="true">Wednesday, December the 24<span>th</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just learnt from <a href="http://twitter.com/IndianGuru">@IndianGuru</a>‘s tweet about <a href="http://www.vestaldesign.com/design/ruby-ref">RubyRef</a> – it’s an iPhone app for Ruby Doc.</p>

<p>Sound like a nice idea – however redundancy was already a thought by the time I went to the Appstore to check it out. However I am spoilt by free iPhone app already – and seeing a tag of $0.99 I didn’t care to even try it. Here’s why -</p>

<p>1) There’s hardly any time I am coding Ruby/Rails I am not online. And there’s really great free doc (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.rubybrain.com">rubybrain</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.railsbrain.com">railsbrain</a>, and the excellent one stop shop <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.gotapi.com">gotapi</a>). When I have these at a keypress away, why will I turn to the iPhone?</p>

<p>2) I find myself copy-pasting most of the time I am looking up some obsecure Ruby functionality. Agreed, Ruby makes it concise. It’s not like you have to a) code up an Iterator, b) have a while loop to go thru it c) and finally iterate, like in some other languages – Ruby is good at being concise. But still, you gotta cut-paste sometimes right?</p>

<p>3) I find myself working with different Ruby/Rails versions all the time. Ruby 1.8.7/Rails 2.2 at home, Ruby 1.8.6/Rails 1.2 at work (don’t get it started on why) – so I find rubybrain/railsbrain very useful for this purpose. I haven’t tried RubyRef yet – but looking at the screenshots it probably supports one version. Especially with Rails evolving all the time, we definitely need something like that</p>

<p>4) I haven’t talked about ri/irb combo yet – I find them very useful for Ruby docs. Right in the shell, no context switch to move to the browser/phone. Even if you don’t use them, having a downloaded copy of the doc (from rubybrain for example) will probably be much more easier to refer to than the iPhone.</p>

<p>I mean, I don’t see myself coding Ruby/Rails without a computer (at least now). As long as I have a computer won’t ri/irb/rubybrain/downloaded-doc be easier to refer than the iPhone?</p>

<p>I had all the intentions of trying the app out – but given so many good, free alternatives I don’t think I’ll try a 99 cent app.</p>

<p>What about you?</p>
