<p>Last weekend I, <strong>Ujwala </strong>and two of my old time friends, <strong>Daboo </strong>and <strong>Nandini </strong>met up in <strong>Vegas</strong>.</p>

<p>We went around, saw the fabulous (should I say decadently smashing) hotels/resorts/casinos and did a little money-wasting (it would be hard to call slot machines gambling). The <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/mystere/mystere-Las-Vegas.htm">Cirque Du Soleil Mystere show</a> was really superb – perhaps the best live performance (in theater/circus area) I have seen. The crazy horse show was… well… disappointing.</p>

<p>We had <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grca/">Grand Canyon</a> in mind when we were planning for the trip but heavy snow and bad weather made us cancel it. And <a href="http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/">Hoover Dam</a> too… <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" /></p>

<p>But we did go over to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/deva/">Death Valley National Park</a> Area and <a href="http://www.redrockcanyonlv.org/">Red Rock Canyon</a> – was rocking!</p>

<p><strong>My top five</strong> of the trip are -
1) <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/mystere/mystere-Las-Vegas.htm">Cirque Du Soleil Mystere show</a>
2) <a href="http://www.redrockcanyonlv.org/">Red Rock Canyon</a>
3) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badwater">Badwater Basin</a> (and the drive to/from)
4) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip">The fabulous Vegas Strip</a> – special mention goes to <a href="http://www.bellagio.com/amenities/fountains-of-bellagio.aspx">Bellagio fountains</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn_Las_Vegas">Wynn resort</a>, The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD5yUQqmSLQ&amp;feature=related">Mirage Volcanic fountains</a>
5) The view from top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere_Las_Vegas">Stratosphere tower</a></p>

<p>Taking this opportunity, let me showcase a few of my pictures. All my photos from the trip at <strong><a href="http://arnab-o-scope.smugmug.com/gallery/7346028_QEfwd#472798549_SQvyN">arnab-o-scope on smugmug</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Daboo also took some great pictures. They are at <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nandini.gogoi/LasVegas?authkey=rV1O2jVklyo#">Nandini’s picasa album</a>)</p>

  <p>Just got back from Las Vegas. The trip was good (details and pics coming soon) – but I did not tip the cab on my way back from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle-Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea-Tac</a> Airport to my place today.</p>

<p>I usually do. And a lot. In fact my friends say that I tip too much – whether in restaurants, in saloons or in cabs. Today was different – and I honestly did not think that the driver deserved even a cent. Moreover, I actually wrote down a big “$ 0.00″ in the tip section of the receipt. Here’s what happened, from scratch.</p>

<p>Got down at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle-Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea-Tac</a> around 9:35 PST. The Seattle Metro bus 194 had just left and the next one was a 30 minute wait. BTW, the Metro 194 route is a real nice transport to/from the airport if you are in downtown Seattle. The route is via I-5 and it takes about 30 min to get there – hassle free. And after you read what I am about to write, I hope you will also rate the Metro 194 as a good service – at least better than some cabs.</p>

<p>So we decided to get a cab home – and got into one. I have taken cabs from SeaTac to my house 7 times in the last 1.5 years. And I am positive that it was always around $34-$36 – and I would mark it up to $40 and a nice “thank you”. Today it ran up to $41.</p>

<p>Anyway that’s not the problem – I wanted to know if the fare had increased (I remember that there is a flat rate of around $33 to/from SeaTac and downtown). So I asked the driver if there was a flat rate from SeaTac. He said that it’s $35 flat from downtown to SeaTac but not while returning. And I thought they have a card in every cab that states the flat rates – so I asked for it. The guy was pissed off. I don’t know what crime I committed (as far as I know, I asked him in the most polite way possible – I didn’t want to come off as a cheapo).</p>

<p>He got agitated and said that there’s no such card, the fares increased in October and I can pay him $41 now. So I asked him if he can swipe my card (I was carrying $40 cash – as my previous experience had thought me to to). He took the card, swiped it and asked me to sign my receipt.</p>

<p>It was all okay till this part – here’s when the fun started. I was giving him my autograph when he started off in Hindi – “Tum saale Desi logon ka yahii problem hai”. (for my non-hindi-speaking friends, that means something like “This is the problem with you Desi (Indian) people”) hmmm… I was not gonna take that sitting back – and I thought it was a racial slur. As far as I am concerned, the situation or my behavior did not warrant a racial slur (really, nothing does. Or should). I had never heard (or maybe I never recognized it) racial abuse so far – and that too from another Indian/Pakistani? <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> . So I told him, in English, as I didn’t want to go down this path – that, this was uncalled-for and was really bad.</p>

<p>By now he was out of control – shouting and enraged (and I swear I did not call him any names at all). So I said, I am not going to sign the receipt if this goes on. I asked him to shake hands, take the receipt and go home (Ok, even I was not the most polite person by now, but I was not bad-mouthing). His reply was – “Pay and get out of my cab.” He tried to threaten me by picking up the phone and starting to dial someone. I thought it was the police – and that they would be fair mediators <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> So I said, “Who are you calling, the Police? Ok – let’s wait for them – I am not signing the receipt till then.” And then he gave in, again shouted me to get out of his car.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got his badge number and details – and he asked me if I was going to file a complaint. On hearing “yes, obviously” he shrugged and muttered something.</p>

<p>So – I just left all the details of the complaint on the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/consumeraffairs/fsw&amp;m.htm">Seattle TaxiCab complaint hotline</a> (BTW – a nice IVR system. I initially expected them to call me back during “working hours” – the number’s 206-296-TAXI). Also left a voice mail with STITA cabs complaint line.</p>

<p>Maybe the fare has risen and is now more than $40. Maybe the sites that Google turns up are still not updated with the latest fares (they still say the fare should be around $35) -
<a href="http://www.engr.washington.edu/epp/icders/transp.html">http://www.engr.washington.edu/epp/icders/transp.html</a>
<a href="http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/ground/groundrates.shtml#d">http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/ground/groundrates.shtml#d</a></p>

<p>Or maybe the meter was rigged? Maybe STITA cabs really deserve the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/stita-taxi-seattle">bad bad reviews they have on yelp</a> (oh and they are going to get another one in a few minutes).</p>

<p>But what I am sure of is that it did not deserve all the rude behavior, racial slurs I got from the driver.</p>

<p>Let’s see what turns up – both complaint lines acknowledged the entry and said that they will get back (in fact I have heard good things about Seattle Cab complaints) within a few days. Will update the blog when I hear from them.</p>

  <p>So <a href="http://website.grader.com">Website Grader</a> tells me that I should get the blog listed in Technorati – maybe someday (soon) I’ll write something meaningful! <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>So here goes – this is to claim my blog in Technorati -

  <p>People have always been telling me to get move away from blogger. In late 2008, I read a few really good articles on why – and I was convinced. Sorry – but it seems I did not bookmark(<a href="http://delicious.com/arnab.deka/">delicious</a> them). Tried to look for them now, but I get a few business oriented results only.</p>

<p>Anyway, I always wanted to get my own domain. And play around with Rails, Capistrano etc. to launch it. So here it is. I did spend a lot of time creating it. But finally, I think I am going the low-hanging-fruit (agile?) way – so right now it’s the simple, easy and open source <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> running on my host.</p>

<p>I am planning to add some dynamic mashup content (like my activity list from all the services I use, and some news that I feed in all mashed up). Let’s see where it goes.</p>

<p>A few of my early 2009 goals were to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>, master vim and Rails and then use all that to prototype my site. Status</p>

<ul>
<li>Dvorak – home row + 4 top row keys done – progress is slow – but it’s good</li>
<li>vim – well I have been using it for a couple of years now. But now I am really learning it. I really like Swaroop C H’s <a href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Vim">A Byte of Vim</a>. And with some snazzy plugins (rails.vim, project.vim, surround.vim and fuzzyfind.vim it is really becoming the best editor ever)</li>
<li>Rails – I have been using it for a year now. And I can do the “good stuff” – but now I am learning in-depth. Feels great to learn the details of the various components</li>
</ul>


<p>Along the way, git came. And I got hooked to that too. But anyway, things <strong>are</strong> moving along and I am happy about that.</p>

<p>So one of my goals (getting my site working) is done. Here it is – <a href="http://www.arnab-deka.com"><strong>www.arnab-deka.com</strong></a> (bye bye blogger – will miss you)</p>

<p>Now it’s up to improving it. Will keep you updated!</p>

  <p>On Jan 7th, 2009 I completed a year at Amazon and Seattle!</p>

<p>What a year it has been! At first I had some doubts about leaving all the people I know (at NYC) and coming over to a new far away place and to a radically different organization. But, now that I look back on it, and I hope I am not speaking too soon, it looks like it was one of the best decisions in my life!</p>

<p>Thanks to Amazon and my colleagues (special thanks goes to <a href="http://saaridev.wordpress.com">Ali Rizvi</a>) and the awesome community of brilliant engineers at Amazon I have gained a totally new view of technology in the large, programming to be concise.</p>

<p>It’s a world I am loving and living every moment. And the Stocks that you get after a year helps too <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>And I met <a href="http://twitter.com/ujwala">Ujwala</a> here! Bet you’ll be hearing a lot about that!</p>

<p>So what do you think? Hasn’t it been an awesome year?</p>
