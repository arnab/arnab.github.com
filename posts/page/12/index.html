Ok it really does not rain that much here – but it’s overcast most of the time. And drizzling… yada yada yada… But statically it’s less than LA, NYC, Miami and most eastern-seaboard cities.</p>

<p>However – “RAIN” is a big part of of Seattle life (It’s not called Rainy City for nothing! That reminds me – it’s also called Emerald City – but I haven’t seen any lying around yet)…</p>

<p>Anyway so much so that our intranet has a full wiki devoted to jokes on Seattle and Rain (which is not a big surprize since the Amazon intranet, rather wiki, is full of, ummm, ANYTHING – from comparisons on Grocery Stores to Even-Horizons/Black-holes and to some really good tech material).</p>

<p>This page has a load of jokes – here are my top three:</p>

<h1>3 You can apply the old Mt. Rainer forecasting guide.</h1>

<ol>
<li>If you can see Mt. Rainier it isn’t raining but it will be soon.</li>
<li>If you can’t see Mt. Rainer, it is raining, and if not on your head, it will be shortly!</li>
</ol>


<p>(<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Mt.+Rainier,+WA&amp;sll=47.606273,-122.337716&amp;sspn=0.010257,0.020943&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=47.115,-121.904297&amp;spn=1.325194,2.680664&amp;z=9&amp;om=0">Mt. Rainier</a> is a range of mountains to the SW of Seattle – there are 2 other ranges, Olympics and Cascades surrounding Seattle – hence the rain!!! Go read up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington">Seattle in wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h1>2 “I can’t believe it,” said the tourist. “I’ve been here an entire week and it’s done nothing but rain. When do you have summer here?”</h1>

<p>“Well, that’s hard to say,” replied the local. “Last year, it was on a Wednesday.”</p>

<h1>1 A newcomer to Seattle arrives on a rainy day. He gets up the next day and it’s raining. It also rains the day after that, and the day after that. He goes out to lunch and sees a young kid and asks out of despair, “Hey kid, does it ever stop raining around here?” The kid says, “How do I know? I’m only 6.”</h1>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever seen a grown-up man cry? I’ve seen myself a few times… But that never invokes the kind of emotion that I experienced today…</p>

<p>I was stuck in office and had almost forgotten about lunch. I noticed around 2 PM and since this-thing-I-was-doing was interesting enough, I thought about getting a quick soup from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Specialty%27s&amp;near=Seattle,+WA+98104&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;radius=1.000000&amp;ei=9KSfR72JDaiArQK9ue3HCg&amp;sig2=LHgBGVBS5VOlsYH53eRrAQ&amp;cd=1&amp;cid=47598347,-122327660,17604595197055989879&amp;li=lmd&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A&amp;om=0">Specialty’s</a> (it’s one of the 15+ cafe/restaurants near my office) – and when I am in a hurry and not very hungry, I go there… Nice thick soups for around $3-5.</p>

<p>Anyway, so I was just outside when I saw a beggar (it’s usual to see one in Seattle – and IMHO, more so in Seattle than in NYC). On an average, I usually see 1 beggar in a day (maybe because I travel back home around 9 or 10 at night? Maybe my opinion would have changed if I went home earlier, or if I was out around this time more regularly in NYC)
It has become so regular that my instinct has been honed to murmur something like “I am only carrying cards – no cash” with a sad-smile and walk away. I won’t be lying if I say that I really don’t have any cash on me 99% of the time.</p>

<p>But this guy was different – most guys are used to such a reply and give a damn about it. This guy asked me again, “Please if you have any part of a dollar – even a penny” and I could see the pain or the need in his eyes… But I was walking away so fast – my brain could not catch up to my heart.</p>

<p>Once I got the soup I saw this guy again from the window – he was crying now – and I could see the pain in his eyes now again, only much worse. I checked my wallet but I really did not have any cash at all. And I had just paid for the soup with my card. I wanted to help him but did not know how… Anyway, I was still not so emotionally charged as I would be 2 minutes from then and so, started back to the office…</p>

<p>Just when I was about to enter through the door, I HEARD him cry… yes – he was crying loudly now… I felt so bad I stopped and looked back… I felt like giving him the soup I had with me… But before I realized he was already walking away.</p>

<p>Once in the elevator, I felt this sudden depressive emotion – man it was an awful feeling. I wish you never have to see that face or hear that cry/sob – of a grown man in real (emotional) pain.</p>

<p>I remember giving away $20 to a stranger in Jersey City one day – and earning a lot of flak from my friends… But I said it then, and I say it now, this guy looked like he needed the soup/$20 much more than I did.</p>

<p>I know (or at least, I perceive, like most of us) that most of the beggars are well-capable of acting. But what if this guy was not acting?</p>

<p>All this happened in a matter of 4-5 min, but left a lasting sad feeling in me. I know I cannot do anything for that man now but maybe putting this down in a blog will make me feel less guilty?</p>

<p>And a very un-important question – what the hell do I do with this soup now?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Came across a very nice feature of MySQL – thought to share it with you.
Well actually, it is one of the main reasons why MySQL is succeeding – so not really an obscure nice feature at all!!! In fact, very well known and appreciated by the community…</p>

<p>(MySQL is a GNU Public licensed Database – and FREEly available. You can go for enterprise option and get support too. Recently Sun bought MySQL!!!)</p>

<p>Anyway, coming back to the point – it has a concept of a Pluggable Storages Engine. So when you write the DDL for creating the table, you specify which engine should be used to store the table – like so:</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MY_FUNKLY_TABLE (
MY_FUNKY_ID CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
FUNKY_DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
IS_IT_REALLY_FUNKY ENUM(‘Y’, ‘N’) DEFAULT ‘Y’,</p>

<p>PRIMARY KEY (MY_FUNKY_ID)
) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin
;</p>

<p>So what’s the deal? Well you can specify whether you want the table to be stored in memory or actually in storage; you can kinda tell what it’s used for – Archiving? Have BDB (BerkleyDB) type features!!! Different types of engines are MyISAM, InnoDB, BDB, Memory, Merge, Archive, Federated, Cluster/NDB, Other – read more about each type in the links given below…</p>

<p>Moreover, you can implement any engine (MyOwnEngine) and plug that into MySQL – cool ha?</p>

<p>The best part is a story I heard from someone recently – a table was taking up around 1.5 GB – after converting it to Archive engine, it became 47MB!!!
A 32 times reduction in space!!!</p>

<p>Yeah yeah yeah – I agree it depends on what sorta data was there in the first place – but still 32 times (3200% to put it differently <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> ) is a lot man!!!</p>

There was the Amazon Developer Conference last 2 days (Jan 16th and 17th ‘ 2008) – it’s yearly event… Among others was Tim O’Reilly presenting “The O’Reilly Radar” – basically talking about the new things in the internet/tech space!!!</p>

<p>I hope to write more about it and the other talks… but before that I have to tell you about this idea that I loved a lot: www.weatherbill.com</p>

<p>This thing startled me… It’s like an insurance on weather… on top of that… you can bet on the weather and if you win they pay you!!!
Go to the site and try the quoting thing. You put a condition (like I am saying it’s going to snow above 5 inches each day between 1/27 and 1/29 at Zip Code 07310 – if that happens you pay me $10 a day!!!)</p>

<p>Now it takes your details and uses its own weather predicting algorithm (at the minimum I would assume it to be very very complicated) and gives you a quote – you buy that quote and if it really snows above 5 inches each day in that period you get paid)… I am sure you got the analogy – it’s like an Option – but on weather!!!</p>

<p>That and much more – go to the site and read blogs about it!!!</p>

<p>BTW: Started by an ex-google guy… <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>More to come – watch this space…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine living in an apartment full of strangers and not-so-friendly-doormen (add strict apartment regulations).
Now imagine you live alone (or maybe your roomie is away – unreachable for all practical purpose).
Next, imagine you never thought or felt it’s important to have a backup of your keys. Yeah now you know where I am going…</p>
But, no, you didn’t drop it somewhere (that will be a real nightmare – and probably you won’t be in a position or mood to write a blog about it shortly afterwards) – you, being the big absent-minded buffoon you are, left it inside the apartment and locked the door. Huh… there you go…</p>

<p>Of course I can never do something like that. But it’s possible for anybody. And so, even though I never experienced the very same thing – let alone THREE times in the last ONE year, I still gained enough wisdom to educate the naive world about the problems that this comes with. If you read on, you will even find a grand solution to this problem.</p>

<p>I could rant on and on about the possible unfortunate situations you might be in. Let’s just name a few random ones, just for your sake:</div>
1.  You parents/sister might be temporarily visiting you. All their stuff could be inside the house. It might be 11 PM. It might even be the night before the grand long-awaited morning on which you take them for a vacation to Florida – the flight being at 5 AM. God save your parents/sister…
2.  You might be too boozed to even walk properly (and that usually does not happen before around 2 AM – if you are like me). God save you…
3.  The apartment rules say that you have to pay $100 for every unlock!!! Again, God save you man…
4.  The doorman could be a real ***|hole – saying the guy who unlocks the room is unavailable till next morning (and you already read points 2 &amp; 3 above right?). God save the doorman!!!</p>

<p>Anyway, I can think of at least another 1000 ***|*ed-up situations like this. But I never waste time. You can keep thinking though…</p>
Of course, a man like me will never be caught in any of these situations… Because I have the perfect solution (rather a prevention) for this – my TWICKs!!!</p>

<p>And the best news – I am going to share that with you. Of course you will say (after reading) that you thought of this a long time ago – you already knew about it!!! What crap! Even I can say that – No one told me about this (not a guy named Rajesh Ramanathan anyway) – I thought of this solution myself.</p>

<p>But the real truth is, I really thought of this myself – and you just read it in my blog. However, I am generous enough not to apply for a US Patent for this method. So you can boast whatever you want.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough and more digressing. Let’s come back to the solution: You just need a simple formula to remind you before you get out of your house.</p>

<p>For those of you mathematically gifted, think of 5 (it could be less or for you. It’s 5 for me. As it is, for some very basic concepts – The 5 elements, The 5 sacred Sikh symbols, the 5 basics pillars of Islam, Maroon 5, The 5 oceans, The Pentium!!! Whatever, I am digressing again – 5 is for me).</p>

<p>For the rest of you, think “TWICK” (again it could be something else for you. And I could ramble on about very basic concepts evolving around “TWICK” – but the word does it for me).</p>

<p>Before leaving the room, I always count 5 things, the “TWICK”s. If the count or letters are missing – something’s missing. Very very simple.</p>

<p>What the hell is TWICK – Timepiece, Wallet, iPod, Cell and Keys (in no particular order)…</p>

<p>Now that you have read it all – go integrate this into your life.</p>

<p>Feel like killing me ? First do that to the doorman who did this to me!!!</p>
