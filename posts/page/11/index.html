Whoops, just lost the all important 100-line-complicated query that you had made 2 minutes ago? Or maybe something as important that you given to the windows clipboard to keep?</p>

<p>I used to find myself in this situation a lot – then I found ClipBoard Diary! <a href="http://softvoile.com/clipdiary">http://softvoile.com/clipdiary</a></p>

<p>A very convenient and non-intrusive way to remember all the clipboard entries. (Just Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down to see all your clipboard entries). And it remembers the entries even after a reboot (or a crash – we are talking about Windows here remember?) – how? uses a Database.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p>Sometimes you feel lonely when you are alone – other times you feel in touch with yourself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes you feel lonely when you are alone – other times you feel in touch with yourself.</p>
>>>>>>> Site updated at 2013-10-04 06:03:48 UTC

<p>During my growing up days (not that I make any claims that that phase is completely over <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> ) I used to spend a lot of times by myself – and I used to feel so good afterwards.</p>

<p>Today I am getting that feeling back again. Have you ever felt this feeling of being alone but not fully too? It’s nice I tell you – or maybe it’s just me.</p>

<p>So I woke up at 6 AM today (I have almost forgotten that there exists single-digit AMs nowadays – oh wait – there is 2 and 3 AM! Right! But anything after that – naaah!)</p>

<p>And I worked after that – believe me – I worked at 6 AM although there was no real urgency to that effect. But this somehow ruined my day I guess – I went late to work and the whole day just passed like that – meetings and discussions. I did manage to scrape in the bare minimum work anyway…</p>

<p>But the whole day I was feeling like I wanted to spend some time with myself – just doing nothing. Enough of doing something all the time.</p>

<p>So I went for a movie – I wanted to see these 4 or 5 movies since 2 weeks – and I finally made 1 today. Definitely, Maybe. Turned out I liked it a lot – reminds me of my life in some ways – anyway it was a nice movie. Then I started having these solitude/melancholy feelings – yes these words generally are associated with a negative state of mind – but from my personal experience – it’s good for you – as long as it’s short time. Considering tomorrow morning I have to go play cricket at 8 AM and have lots of other plans for the day there’s not much scope of this mood getting extended.</p>

<p>Anyway – right now I am sitting in my balcony – with lights dimmed out – and Nirvana’s acoustic tracks playing in the background – looking at the streets 23 floors below me, the mild rain and the people – the lights from all these high-rises around me. Nice… Nirvana just does something to me…</p>

<p>Basically just enjoying the atmosphere – thinking things slowly in a relaxed manner (ok with a beer too – I love European beers by the way) – and that’s it.</p>

<p>Quite an abrupt ending – but I never much to say to start with <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>But I feel I am always waiting for something. Always this or that. Kabhi ek mast job, kabhi job satisfaction, kabhi cricket, kabhi koi dost ke liye, kabhi kisi type ka approval ke liye.</p>

<p>But it’s always the waiting that gets to me!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" />
That’s it – no elaboration of any of the above… people who know me well enough will know what I mean. Some will know one or two of the “waits”, hopefully some will know it all!</p>

<p>That’s exactly how I am feeling today. The day began as best in quite a while – yes you guessed it – another night out. But it was special.</p>

<p>One of my closest friends (Diganta – or Diggy as he’s known here) left for India today – ending his tenure at Seattle and moving back to Bangalore Infosys. So we had a party last night – and believe it or not – we were around 15 guys and we finished 84 beer cans! <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>The best part of the beers was the new stunt called “shotgunning” that a cool dude called Stan introduced. Make a small hole towards the bottom of the beer can – cover it with your mouth (so don’t spill any yet) – and then pop-open the can! It’s amazing – the full beer goes down with some awesome pressure – if you like beer you must try this once! More on this in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgunning">the wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>So yeah – you guessed it – we were having fun alright! And then I was a bit dizzy and I went back to GTalk – where I have spent quite some time recently <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>And to my pleasent surprize I caught the person I was hoping to catch online! There’s something wrong between us and the conversations are just amazing! You have to see it to believe it! Anyway, we chatted for an hour or so – then I got the phone number – and then we talked till morning 630! No sleep or no sleepy feeling at all!</p>

<p>And then was the best part – we went out to have breakfast to downtown Seattle – it was a nice drive and we ended up spending some time talking and driving! I really like this person’s company and I guess it can develope into a really nice friendship. But there are always complications in life huh? <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>So what a nice morning isn’t it? I mean come on – how often do you spend the night talking and then go have a nice morning drive and breakfast at a fab place? With a person you find so interesting?</p>

<p>Anyway – after that – the rest of the day was spent with Diggy – just talking – lunch and stuff. Finally we all (around 15 ppl again) went to the airport to see him off! Popular guy eh? (It kinda reminded me of the time when everyone came to see me off when I was leaving NYC for Seattle in Jan’08). Liked it.</p>

<p>And then I came home to my fabulous downtown apartment! And just looked at the beautiful sunset over the Pudget Sound and the Olympics that I see from my balconies.</p>

<p>And then I started feeling kinda low again – you know this lonely feeling? I know it’s normal to feel that way – to put it right I have never had a better professional life yet – I just love the job I have right now – and that comes at a price right? But yeah – sometimes I do feel lonely… so that’s what I was doing today evening…</p>

<p>So that’s High and Low for me today… One of the highest I have been recently and then feeling so low in the evening. Anyway I am feeling quite at piece now that I wrote this blog – Gonna have dinner and watch a nice movie… and tomorrow morning’s gonna be cricket – so yay! Hopefully another High day? <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>So I miss my friends in NY and not yet full used to my life in Seattle – so to get a taste of how life was, back in NY, I am traveling there this weekend. Right now I am about 30 min away from Seattle – wait, that’s flight time – so it should be around 300 miles (since an Airbus A320 travels around 560-620 mph in good weather conditions and I cannot say there is even a small blemish in the clouds today!
So I must be flying over the Rockies right now – seems like it anyway – Maybe the gorges that I am seeing are parts of the Bryce Canion.</p>

<p>I wish I was a an artist – I wish I could draw this thing – but only if wishes were horses <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" />
Maybe even the best artist cannot draw this beauty in a physical medium – you have to experience it.</p>

<p>This is my 5th cross-country flight – Coast-to-coast non-stop and I always liked the flights.</p>

<p>At the east coast nothing can beat the majestic show of pomp that NYC skyline is – if you land/take off at night. Oh I don’t know if you’ll get a more engrossing skyline anywhere else in the world – you just have to see the skyscrapers of midtown and downtown rise out (as you descend) of the vast see of light that is the tri-state metropolitan area (NY, NJ and PA).
If you fly to NY from inside the US, you’ll get to see the orange glow of NYC about half an hour before you are anywhere near it. Then you’ll see the sea of light and then in the last moments of your flight you’ll see the Grand NYC skyline emerge from there! It’s like a Hollywood movie – I have to tell you.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you land/take-off from Seattle during the day – that’s another sight. It’s not called Emerald or Green City for nothing. Seattle is an isthmus surrounded by quite a few water bodies and mountain ranges.
It’s between the Lake Washington and Pudget Sound (which connects to the Pacific ocean about 50 miles west of Seattle) and surrounded by modern satellite cities like Redmond (Microsoft), Kirkland (Google) and Tacoma/Renton (Boeing), Bellevue (residential area).</p>

<p>And the whole area is so beautiful – you have to see it once in the summer – if you are in the USA.</p>

<p>But tonight’s experience is quite different from these sights – tonight is the first time I am flying out of Seattle at night. And I thought why do they brag that Seattle is the west coast;s 2nd largest city. Well I live and work in the heart of Seattle – and I always got the impression that it’s s small city (maybe 10 miles by 10 miles). Now when we took off – I saw that the story is indeed like the tri-state area – vast sea of lights!!! No doubt I am a prouder Seattlite (is that what we are called?) now!
That’s nowhere near the best part thought…</p>

<p>I always say and believe that man can never meet nature’s beauty.</p>

<p>So right now – I am over the Rockies. It’s 30 min pat midnight. And a few days after a full-moon (I think 2-3 days). For the record, it’s 2 days after the lunar eclipse that I saw while playing tennis!
There is a bit of cloud in the sky – more like a mist coat strewn here and there.</p>

<p>And the mountains below me are full of snow.</p>

<p>You can guess what I am about to say – Soft moonlight falling on the deep gorges and peaks on the mountains below me – strikingly highlighting the ravines and the whole terrain. And the misty clouds diffusing the moonlight in a dreamy sort of way!</p>

<p>Oh man – I really have never seen anything like this – Is this what you call ghastly beautiful?</p>

<p>There is not a single sign of humanity as far as I can see – only white snowy mountains and deep gorges – shining off the moonlight. Brings a mixture of feelings – lonely, scared and hauntingly beautiful. yes even though it’s so haunting – it’s so beautiful!</p>

<p>If you are reading this blog – please do take a flight out of Seattle at night – on a clear night – with abundant moonlight around. Well yeah – you are right – you need luck to see things – and I guess some people have all the luck! heh heh heh…</p>

<p>As for me, my colleague was talking of a hiking trip to the Bryce Canion sometime this summer – now I have to do it!</p>

<p>Good night – see you tomorrow at NY!</p>
