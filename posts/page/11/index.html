  <p>Went to an incredible talk today and was so damn impressed with the presentation and the concepts behind. So wanted to share it with you…&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<p>Basically the talk was on Consensus among Distributed Systems. So if you have a Master DB and two Slaves – and if the master dies, how do you choose which Slave to promote, automatically?&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<p>Or consider you have some sort of a pool of managers who decide what to do and a bigger pool of workers who do what the managers say. Let’s say a manager dies – how do you choose which worker to promote to a manager? Because all of them might be equally eligible to get promoted (we are talking about systems here not humans).&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<p>The simple way is – go for the majority. So every worker votes and one of them is elected. But then take in some factors such as message losses, network disturbance and partial network failure – now your vote might not have been so accurate after all ha?&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<p>Good Robust systems built to be successful must be fault-tolerant and self-healing. It has to take care of its own – if some process fails, it has to figure out a way to fix it by itself – no human intervention – coz that takes time and money – which is not always easy or affordable. Now if it’s just one system you could somehow make it think of these situations. But make a distributed system where each worker has its own mind! The group (distributed system) has to come to _correct_ decision somehow right?&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<p>&lt;o:p> &lt;/o:p>To build such (distributed) systems we need to be able to solve this problem of consensus. A few people have started or already have implemented this (including Google Chubby, Microsoft Autopilot, Amazon S3 etc.)&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<p>&lt;o:p> &lt;/o:p>
So this talk was about all this – must say it was done in a very lively manner – with a skit showing the different parts of the system, the network (where volunteers passed messages and took parts of the system – some _crashed_ too ). Was fun!&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<p>&lt;o:p> &lt;/o:p>
The idea stems from ancient ages and has been modeled to meet the requirements we have today. It’s called Paxos Protocol. Do read up on it – very interesting… You will definitely have nothing but appreciation for the great minds that created the mathematical model in those ancient times and the other great minds who translated it to modern day distributed systems and the other minds who have/are implementing these ideas!&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

  <p>Typing something in an e-mail and you need to copy some site’s link. What’s the big deal? Select, Ctrl+C.
Whoops, just lost the all important 100-line-complicated query that you had made 2 minutes ago? Or maybe something as important that you given to the windows clipboard to keep?</p>

<p>I used to find myself in this situation a lot – then I found ClipBoard Diary! <a href="http://softvoile.com/clipdiary">http://softvoile.com/clipdiary</a></p>

<p>A very convenient and non-intrusive way to remember all the clipboard entries. (Just Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down to see all your clipboard entries). And it remembers the entries even after a reboot (or a crash – we are talking about Windows here remember?) – how? uses a Database.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p>Sometimes you feel lonely when you are alone – other times you feel in touch with yourself.</p>

<p>During my growing up days (not that I make any claims that that phase is completely over <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /> ) I used to spend a lot of times by myself – and I used to feel so good afterwards.</p>

<p>Today I am getting that feeling back again. Have you ever felt this feeling of being alone but not fully too? It’s nice I tell you – or maybe it’s just me.</p>

<p>So I woke up at 6 AM today (I have almost forgotten that there exists single-digit AMs nowadays – oh wait – there is 2 and 3 AM! Right! But anything after that – naaah!)</p>

<p>And I worked after that – believe me – I worked at 6 AM although there was no real urgency to that effect. But this somehow ruined my day I guess – I went late to work and the whole day just passed like that – meetings and discussions. I did manage to scrape in the bare minimum work anyway…</p>

<p>But the whole day I was feeling like I wanted to spend some time with myself – just doing nothing. Enough of doing something all the time.</p>

<p>So I went for a movie – I wanted to see these 4 or 5 movies since 2 weeks – and I finally made 1 today. Definitely, Maybe. Turned out I liked it a lot – reminds me of my life in some ways – anyway it was a nice movie. Then I started having these solitude/melancholy feelings – yes these words generally are associated with a negative state of mind – but from my personal experience – it’s good for you – as long as it’s short time. Considering tomorrow morning I have to go play cricket at 8 AM and have lots of other plans for the day there’s not much scope of this mood getting extended.</p>

<p>Anyway – right now I am sitting in my balcony – with lights dimmed out – and Nirvana’s acoustic tracks playing in the background – looking at the streets 23 floors below me, the mild rain and the people – the lights from all these high-rises around me. Nice… Nirvana just does something to me…</p>

<p>Basically just enjoying the atmosphere – thinking things slowly in a relaxed manner (ok with a beer too – I love European beers by the way) – and that’s it.</p>

<p>Quite an abrupt ending – but I never much to say to start with <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

  <p>Of course you know what I mean right? You have had to wait for something sometime right?</p>

<p>But I feel I am always waiting for something. Always this or that. Kabhi ek mast job, kabhi job satisfaction, kabhi cricket, kabhi koi dost ke liye, kabhi kisi type ka approval ke liye.</p>

<p>But it’s always the waiting that gets to me!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" />
That’s it – no elaboration of any of the above… people who know me well enough will know what I mean. Some will know one or two of the “waits”, hopefully some will know it all!</p>

  <p>Have you heard A-ha’s Hunting High and Low? You can get a preview <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunting-High-And-Low/dp/B0011Z93II/ref=dmusic_cd_album/105-1136235-0392434">here</a>.</p>

<p>That’s exactly how I am feeling today. The day began as best in quite a while – yes you guessed it – another night out. But it was special.</p>

<p>One of my closest friends (Diganta – or Diggy as he’s known here) left for India today – ending his tenure at Seattle and moving back to Bangalore Infosys. So we had a party last night – and believe it or not – we were around 15 guys and we finished 84 beer cans! <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>The best part of the beers was the new stunt called “shotgunning” that a cool dude called Stan introduced. Make a small hole towards the bottom of the beer can – cover it with your mouth (so don’t spill any yet) – and then pop-open the can! It’s amazing – the full beer goes down with some awesome pressure – if you like beer you must try this once! More on this in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgunning">the wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>So yeah – you guessed it – we were having fun alright! And then I was a bit dizzy and I went back to GTalk – where I have spent quite some time recently <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>And to my pleasent surprize I caught the person I was hoping to catch online! There’s something wrong between us and the conversations are just amazing! You have to see it to believe it! Anyway, we chatted for an hour or so – then I got the phone number – and then we talked till morning 630! No sleep or no sleepy feeling at all!</p>

<p>And then was the best part – we went out to have breakfast to downtown Seattle – it was a nice drive and we ended up spending some time talking and driving! I really like this person’s company and I guess it can develope into a really nice friendship. But there are always complications in life huh? <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>So what a nice morning isn’t it? I mean come on – how often do you spend the night talking and then go have a nice morning drive and breakfast at a fab place? With a person you find so interesting?</p>

<p>Anyway – after that – the rest of the day was spent with Diggy – just talking – lunch and stuff. Finally we all (around 15 ppl again) went to the airport to see him off! Popular guy eh? (It kinda reminded me of the time when everyone came to see me off when I was leaving NYC for Seattle in Jan’08). Liked it.</p>

<p>And then I came home to my fabulous downtown apartment! And just looked at the beautiful sunset over the Pudget Sound and the Olympics that I see from my balconies.</p>

<p>And then I started feeling kinda low again – you know this lonely feeling? I know it’s normal to feel that way – to put it right I have never had a better professional life yet – I just love the job I have right now – and that comes at a price right? But yeah – sometimes I do feel lonely… so that’s what I was doing today evening…</p>

<p>So that’s High and Low for me today… One of the highest I have been recently and then feeling so low in the evening. Anyway I am feeling quite at piece now that I wrote this blog – Gonna have dinner and watch a nice movie… and tomorrow morning’s gonna be cricket – so yay! Hopefully another High day? <img src="http://www.arnab-deka.com/posts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" /></p>
