### Arnab Deka is a <del>20-something</del> 30-something, guy-next-door living in <del>Seattle, WA</del> Bangalore, India.

Right, I turned 30 recently and we moved to India too!

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at
[LivingSocial](http://corporate.livingsocial.com/). I love playing
cricket and tennis. When I can't play, I watch almost any goddamn
sports that on TV/the net. When some major sporting event is not going
on, we love to travel around.

I graduated from REC, Calicut (now
[National Institute of Technology, Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in) in 2004
and started working for
[Infosys Technologies](http://infosys.com/). After working around 3
years at Pune, Bangalore  and NYC I moved to Seattle to work for
[Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/). At Amazon I first worked in the core
supply chain tech team and then at [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/).

I usually work with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Javascript and related
technologies but am always tinkering with the next new thing, lately
Clojure. I am big into aglie practices and developing software in the
TDD/BDD style. (For history's sake I have to mention that I am very
much familiar with the Java-world and remember bits and pieces of the
C/C++ life that I started out with).

My resume is available [here](/resume/). However, know that I am not looking for
a change at this point. Unless, it's like insanely awesome. According
to at least one person excluding you.

You can find my contact information [here](/contact).
