Right, I turned 30 recently and we moved to India too!

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at
[LivingSocial](http://corporate.livingsocial.com/) as a
Senior Software Developer. I love playing cricket and tennis. When I
can't play, I watch almost any goddamn sports that on TV/the net. When
some major sporting event is not going on, we love to travel around.

I graduated from REC, Calicut (now
[National Institute of Technology, Calicut](http://nitc.ac.in) in 2004
and started working for
[Infosys Technologies](http://infosys.com/). After working around 3
years at Pune, Bangalore  and NYC I moved to Seattle to work for
[Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/). At Amazon I first worked in the core
supply chain tech team and then at [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/).

I usually work with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Javascript and related
technologies but am always tinkering with the next new thing. I am big
into aglie practices and developing software in the TDD/BDD style. (For
history's sake I have to mention that I am very much familiar with the
Java-world and remember bits and pieces of the C/C++ life that I
started out with).
