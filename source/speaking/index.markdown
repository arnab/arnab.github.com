After attending a few conferences here and there, I started speaking
in 2014. I mostly speak about topics related to Ruby, but usually
bring in a breath of fresh air to the topics we are already aware of,
by showing examples and patterns used in the world that exists outside
of the Ruby community.

# Upcoming

Would you would like to have me speak at a conference, meet-up or just any
gathering? [Get in touch](/contact/).

# At Conferences

## Feb '14: RubyConf Australia, Sydney

My first talk outside of India, presented at the 2nd edition of the
ever-awesome [*RubyConf AU*](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/). After a
brief overview of threaded concurrency patterns and their problems, I
highlight a lot of the new patterns in concurrency related programming
in the modern world, including:

+ [atoms](http://clojure.org/atoms),
  [agents](http://clojure.org/agents), [refs & STM](http://clojure.org/refs) (all using [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)),
+ [actors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) (using [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)/[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)'s excellent [OTP](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/what-is-otp)),
+ channels or [CSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) or co/[go-routines](http://golang.org/) (using [core.async with Clojure](http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html))

I also showed currently available libraries and patterns that make it
possible to implement these higher level concurrency abstractions in
Ruby.

## Jan '14: Garden City Ruby Conf, Bangalore

I gave a 30-minute talk  at the inaugural edition of
[*Garden City Ruby Conf*](http://www.gardencityruby.org/), introducing
Machine Learning (classification and SVM in particular) and how it can
be used in the Ruby world, using tools like libsvm, weka etc. This was
Bangalore's very own and India's first regional Ruby conference.

# At meetups & events

## Aug '13: RailsGarden, Bangalore

A two-day, small-scale workshop (25 students) to bring in folks from
engineering colleges in and around Bangalore and introduce them to
Ruby and Rails. More [here](http://railsgarden.herokuapp.com/).

I gave the introductory (and hopefully inspirational) talk and guided
couple of students. The response was amazing too:

> If u r organising any other workshop, I highly recommend him as a
> coach
>   - Venkatesh

> Our coach was Arnab. He was totally amazing.
> We did everything from the scratch with his help.
>   - Deeksha

Slides are [here](http://slid.es/arnab_deka/ruby-vs-the-world) and
here's the
[blogging app](https://github.com/arnab/railsgarden_blogbang/) we
built.

## Aug '13: RailsGirls, Bangalore

Coached a group of five excellent students at the first
[RailsGirls event in India](http://railsgirls.com/bangalore). We built
[shorty](https://github.com/arnab/railsgirls_bangalore_shorty), a URL
shortener du jour :)

Some excerpts from the feedback:

> You are really enthusiastic about what you do and that did inspire
> me a lot. I have little bit of work experience ( 1 year )  but it
> wasn't a pleasant one as I was doing maintenance and support work.
> But after seeing people like you who have worked for a long time, my
> perception towards IT industry as a whole has changed a bit and I am
> happy about it.
>   - Abinaya

> The way you explained from scratch the app that was given helped us
> gain a great insight as to how ruby on rails work. The way you
> looked excited when you explained really made us feel interested and
> provided great motivation for further learning.
>   - Haripriya

> Getting in people from different backgrounds and getting them
> excited about a common technology was great. The way the content was
> put across got us more interested with a new technology. The
> enthusiasm of the coaches and the team inspired us.
>   - Roopa
