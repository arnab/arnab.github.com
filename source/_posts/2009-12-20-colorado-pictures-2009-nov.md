Pics from the Colorado trip back in November, 2009 (with Ujwala and Maa). We spent two days in Rocky Mountain National Park and a day over in Colorado Springs and around (Manitou Springs, Pikes Peak – highest peak in that area).

It’s heavenly – have to go there again in Spring 2010 )along with the parks in Wyoming, Montana).
