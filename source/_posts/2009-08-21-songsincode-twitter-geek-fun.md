> This blog is about twitter hastags. To learn more about twitter hashtags, go [here][1].

So #songsincode has been [ruling the twitter trends][2] for a day now. Didn't follow it? No worries - [here's a recent blog][3] with some good (early) ones.

Basically, it was the most fun I have had reading hashtags. Today, after lunch I took a plunge too :)

Original [tweet here][5]:

    (you.breath + you.move).each { i.missing(you) }

Original [tweet here][6]:

    while ( time(you.reverse) < = 1.minute )
      i = you.steps_behind(2)
    end


Oh don't tell me I was so bad you could not even guess the songs ([Every Breath You Take][7] and [Two Steps Behind][8]).
