yay! yay! yay!

My T-mobile contract got over end of July and I finally gave in to the temptation – I got the iPhone 3G today!!! ![:-)][1] (yes in spite of all the bad things ppl are saying about the battery and Exchange integration). I get 14 days to return it so why not try it!

Only two problems till now:

1) Yahoo mail won’t sync! I figured it was the non alphanumeric characters in my password! So apple could not figure out this advanced piece o technology – people do have passwords with non-alphanumeric characters in them. Well it’s only been, umm, 20 years since this “technology” started! ![:-)][1]

2) While setting up the phone, it crashed my OS twice. A-ha – Windows XP. So it’s a classic case of Microsoft v. Apple ![:-)][1] And apple slam-dunked you twice Windows! ![:-)][1]

But other than that, I love the phone!
