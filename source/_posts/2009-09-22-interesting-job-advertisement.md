A recent job opening advert (from [Aardvark, for a Front-End Web Developers][1]) goes:

> Required Skills:
> * Fluency in HTML and CSS
> * Experience taking mockups and turning them into standards-compliant HTML/CSS
> * Expertise in achieving cross-browser compatibility in IE, Firefox, and Safari
> * Experience in implementing grid-based layouts in HTML/CSS
> * Experience in an agile development environment
>
> Pluses:
> * Interest in user experience design and graphic design
> * Experience in Javascript and Ruby on Rails
> * History of side projects and interest in social media, browsers, and mobile web
> * Obsession with new technologies and open source tools
> * Experimental, user focused, and iterative
> * Previous startup experience

I felt the Pluses section was very interesting, specially (you kinda see the others on Rails related job boards anyway):
* History of side projects and interest in social media, browsers, and mobile web
* Obsession with new technologies and open source tools

Shows how today’s start-ups value people who are really interested in what they do (and not just in for the money). An encouraging view of the world indeed – now I just have to get on it and get those much needed Plusses into my skills bag ![:)][2]

Note to my employers, friends, well wishers and anyone else interested: This does not mean I am looking for a job! I love the job I have right now and am just happy to see the importance of “passion” in the world’s view of an ideal employee increasing!
