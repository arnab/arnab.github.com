Typing something in an e-mail and you need to copy some site’s link. What’s the big deal? Select, Ctrl+C.
Whoops, just lost the all important 100-line-complicated query that you had made 2 minutes ago? Or maybe something as important that you given to the windows clipboard to keep?

I used to find myself in this situation a lot – then I found ClipBoard Diary! <http://softvoile.com/clipdiary>

A very convenient and non-intrusive way to remember all the clipboard entries. (Just Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down to see all your clipboard entries). And it remembers the entries even after a reboot (or a crash – we are talking about Windows here remember?) – how? uses a Database.

Enjoy!
