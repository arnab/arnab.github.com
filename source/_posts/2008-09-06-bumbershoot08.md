Bumbershoot is Seattle’s Arts and Music festival. It takes place during the Labor Day weekend (September first weekend usually) every year at the Seattle Center.

Me and Ujwala had gone for day-2, last Sunday… Quite a few shows on. We saw [School of Rock (Paul Green)][2] – really amazing how great kids are! School kids rocking with electric guitars, drums and amazing powerful vocals. Loved it!

Heard [Paramore][3] from the sidelines and saw a few other things as well.

The other highlight was [Offspring][4] – I always wanted to go to one of their concerts. It was fast and good! They even called the fest much bigger than Bumbershoot – it was “BumberSHIT” ![:-)][5]

Here’s a pic from the Offspring concert…
