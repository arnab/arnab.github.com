You know I play cricket in the summer regularly? Yeah – we all play in the Eagles Team.

We did well in the 2008 Summer season. We won 6 out of 9 league matches (and the first was a very thrilling tie). In the last league match we even [scored 102 for 1 wicket][1] (the highest and only 100+ opening partnership) – and I scored 47 there. So we came out 3rd in the league and got promoted to the next level for 2009.

See my [earlier post regarding this][2].

So last Saturday, Jan 24th, we had the ARCL prize distribution ceremony (at Microsoft Cafe #43)

It was good. But
1) we reached late – so didn’t get food ![:-(][4]
2) we came third – and got a nice team trophy. But the 1st and the 2nd spots get personal trophies with names engraved! Well next year!Here’s the link to the [ARCL site 2008 Summer league][5] – it’s one of those sites that work well only on IE (or IE tab, for hardcore FFox-ers).

BTW, is the site screaming for a scrapping-goodness?

**Update on 02-Feb-2009** – [Bharat ][6] took an iPhone pic of the trophy – it looks damn good!
