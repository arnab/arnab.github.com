On Jan 7th, 2009 I completed a year at Amazon and Seattle!

What a year it has been! At first I had some doubts about leaving all the people I know (at NYC) and coming over to a new far away place and to a radically different organization. But, now that I look back on it, and I hope I am not speaking too soon, it looks like it was one of the best decisions in my life!

Thanks to Amazon and my colleagues (special thanks goes to [Ali Rizvi][1]) and the awesome community of brilliant engineers at Amazon I have gained a totally new view of technology in the large, programming to be concise.

It’s a world I am loving and living every moment. And the Stocks that you get after a year helps too ![:-)][2]

And I met [Ujwala][3] here! Bet you’ll be hearing a lot about that!

So what do you think? Hasn’t it been an awesome year?
