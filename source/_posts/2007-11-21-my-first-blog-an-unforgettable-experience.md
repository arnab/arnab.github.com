I had written my first blog almost a year ago - August'06. I did have the pleasure of one person reading it too (thank Anurag!). And like most other things (people too :-)) I did manage to loose it somewhere (the internet is getting too big I guess). Don't laugh - I manage to do that often (especially with people, again).

Now that I am about to start off a (yet another?) new life, I am pledging to myself that I will do it better this time!!! So here goes the first one…

Anyway, I somehow dug it up and hence you can yourself immensely fortunate to read it once again (I wish I could do that with people, again!!! Ok I'll shut up now)…

Here you go:

My first blog is going to be about an unforgettable experience: [The Kite Runner](http://amzn.to/VfIrN8).

I am not an avid reader but I do read books & frequently get immersed in the characters...

Well I got this book just for a train journey... a journey from Bangalore to Chennai, lasts usually 6 hours… I was going for my VISA interview had this as a gift for Lavanya... her birthday had just passed...

I was told to read my petition papers & prepare for the interview... but a few moments with Amir & Hassan wrecked all that... and gave me one of the most moving books I have read... Call me a cry-baby or whatever, but I was (almost, this word added just to save my skin) moved to tears in the train... people were giving me such looks... as if they thought someone died...

I'm not going to (and I sincerely do not have the literary capability to) try to explain the book here... only advise: if you really want to know how hard life can be and how, after facing so much, you still can win, read this one...
