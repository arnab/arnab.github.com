Ok Ok Ok… I’ve not been posting regularly. Mostly a fault of companies like BMW, Nintendo and Amazon…

Yeah, so since my last blog, I got a [BMW 3-series][1], an [Amazon Kindle][2] (as a gift, that too!) and a [Wii][3]. So life’s been busy… driving, reading new stuff and playing fun games! Oh and the introduction of a new person… who keeps me, let’s say, engaged? ![:-)][4]

So all that and stuff like what-I’m-going-to-write-about now is basically what is keeping me from writing more blogs… Believe me, I hardly get to stop a think a moment nowadays… Time’s just flying… what with nice increase in office work too. Thank God I like it – I would have stopped coming to office otherwise. No, really!

So I have turned to micro-blogging… Don’t get me worng, I love to write here… but where’s the time? So I turned to twitter recently. If you haven’t seen that yet – try it out – it’s the latest fad. Like sms-ing and blogging… It’s called Twitting! I mean it – go to [twitter][5] right now and see the demo video. It’s cool… and as most people believe, it’s the future… of smsing/blogging/mailing all-in-one.

So if you still wanna see my updates – whatever handful you are anyway – get on to twitter and find me (or9ob) and follow me. I’ll still continue to write blogs, but they will be rare – like this.

So today I came across this new shiny thing called zembly.

I think I blogged about : <http://heroku.com/> The first online IDE I saw… but that won’t interest most of you as it was only for RubyOnRails.

Look at the new zembly: <http://zembly.com/> Visual-<wbr>coding in Javascript in a nice IDE (read Visual Studio, but much nicer, AJAXy and with lots less errors. AND FREE!).</p>
and the IDE is online! Get APIs for free (like, from, Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Flickr etc.) and publish your WebService/idget/app for free! Quick and easy…

Here’s a Hello-world type WebService I created (I should say it created for me – it was so damn easy):
[http://zembly.com/things/<wbr>a7085d0638fb4ec799379ab499eefe<wbr>71;exec][6]?

and put your name in and see:
[http://zembly.com/things/<wbr>a7085d0638fb4ec799379ab499eefe<wbr>71;exec?name=[your%20name%<wbr>20here]][7]

Never thought it would be so easy to craete a web-service! ![:-)][4]

BTW, they are open for beta users now – check it out, it’s nice…
