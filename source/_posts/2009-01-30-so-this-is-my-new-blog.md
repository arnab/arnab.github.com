People have always been telling me to get move away from blogger. In late 2008, I read a few really good articles on why – and I was convinced. Sorry – but it seems I did not bookmark([delicious][1] them). Tried to look for them now, but I get a few business oriented results only.

Anyway, I always wanted to get my own domain. And play around with Rails, Capistrano etc. to launch it. So here it is. I did spend a lot of time creating it. But finally, I think I am going the low-hanging-fruit (agile?) way – so right now it’s the simple, easy and open source [WordPress][2] running on my host.

I am planning to add some dynamic mashup content (like my activity list from all the services I use, and some news that I feed in all mashed up). Let’s see where it goes.

A few of my early 2009 goals were to learn [Dvorak][3], master vim and Rails and then use all that to prototype my site. Status

*   Dvorak – home row + 4 top row keys done – progress is slow – but it’s good
*   vim – well I have been using it for a couple of years now. But now I am really learning it. I really like Swaroop C H’s [A Byte of Vim][4]. And with some snazzy plugins (rails.vim, project.vim, surround.vim and fuzzyfind.vim it is really becoming the best editor ever)
*   Rails – I have been using it for a year now. And I can do the “good stuff” – but now I am learning in-depth. Feels great to learn the details of the various components

Along the way, git came. And I got hooked to that too. But anyway, things **are** moving along and I am happy about that.

So one of my goals (getting my site working) is done. Here it is – [**www.arnab-deka.com**][5] (bye bye blogger – will miss you)

Now it’s up to improving it. Will keep you updated!
