So I want to drive from Seattle to NYC. No really I want to do that once. Coast to coast.
Well I’ll leave that dream to come true in another blog. It’s a different topic I wanna talk about right now.

So I wanna start at 6 PM from Seattle, let Google Maps (or some other maps) decide the way for me, AND, AND tell me hows the weather gonna be all the along the way.

Now look at this rad site: <http://weatherbonk.com/weather/routeWeather.jsp?>
Start from Seattle, at 6 PM today, and reach NYC in 3 days. And it tells me how the weather’s gonna be along the way. Isn’t that cool?

And there are loads of other options! Cool. Now check out their home page:[ http://weatherbonk.com][1]
I know all this is there in [weather.com][2] too but, this is like, presenting all the *relevant* data in the *relevant* manner!
