I use and love [1Password][1] on my Mac every day – it has become one of those things I can’t live without, and is easily worth the $40 price.

Yesterday they announced their very generous ThanksGiving offer: [Free 1-for-1 license][2]. So I can give away a Free 1Password for Mac license – and since no one else in my family has started using a Mac full-time yet, I will give it away to you!

Just add a comment here – saying why I should give it away to you and wait for a few hours. I will pick one person here and send them the license. Make sure you leave some contact so I can get back to you. How will I pick? The most entertaining comment of course. But yeah – don’t hold me to it, I might just randomly pick someone.

Thank you for playing!
