[![][2]][2] Now I seriously didn’t expect this from Apple. I was so-waiting for the 2.1 update to iPhone – and iTunes couldn’t install it or me! ![:-)][2]



and look at the awesome error message!



Go Apple!

Update after fighting for 20 min or so:
I did a restart of Windows and iTunes – still got the same error.

iTunes documentation says I might need to upgrade my iTunes. So I go and click Check for latest version – and hey I am already on the latest one (iTunes 8).

Then I tried to upgrade iPhone to 2.1 again – and this time it worked. I have to agree to one of my colleagues – is Apple going the Microsoft way???
