Ok it really does not rain that much here – but it’s overcast most of the time. And drizzling… yada yada yada… But statically it’s less than LA, NYC, Miami and most eastern-seaboard cities.

However – “RAIN” is a big part of of Seattle life (It’s not called Rainy City for nothing! That reminds me – it’s also called Emerald City – but I haven’t seen any lying around yet)…

Anyway so much so that our intranet has a full wiki devoted to jokes on Seattle and Rain (which is not a big surprize since the Amazon intranet, rather wiki, is full of, ummm, ANYTHING – from comparisons on Grocery Stores to Even-Horizons/Black-holes and to some really good tech material).

This page has a load of jokes – here are my top three:

#3 You can apply the old Mt. Rainer forecasting guide.

1. If you can see Mt. Rainier it isn’t raining but it will be soon.
2. If you can’t see Mt. Rainer, it is raining, and if not on your head, it will be shortly!

([Mt. Rainier][2] is a range of mountains to the SW of Seattle – there are 2 other ranges, Olympics and Cascades surrounding Seattle – hence the rain!!! Go read up on [Seattle in wikipedia][3])

#2 “I can’t believe it,” said the tourist. “I’ve been here an entire week and it’s done nothing but rain. When do you have summer here?”

“Well, that’s hard to say,” replied the local. “Last year, it was on a Wednesday.”

#1 A newcomer to Seattle arrives on a rainy day. He gets up the next day and it’s raining. It also rains the day after that, and the day after that. He goes out to lunch and sees a young kid and asks out of despair, “Hey kid, does it ever stop raining around here?” The kid says, “How do I know? I’m only 6.”
