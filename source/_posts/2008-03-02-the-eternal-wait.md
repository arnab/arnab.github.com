Of course you know what I mean right? You have had to wait for something sometime right?

But I feel I am always waiting for something. Always this or that. Kabhi ek mast job, kabhi job satisfaction, kabhi cricket, kabhi koi dost ke liye, kabhi kisi type ka approval ke liye.

But it’s always the waiting that gets to me!

That’s it – no elaboration of any of the above… people who know me well enough will know what I mean. Some will know one or two of the “waits”, hopefully some will know it all!
